# SBA 308A
> [!Note]
> I made a weather API where you type in any city you like and my application will tell you the weather conditions for that city!

#### Link to the Live Site:

- [Weather App](https://iisurf.github.io/sba308A/)

#### My very first API and I am very pleased that it is working. Definitely a major learning curve but got it done.

#### What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

- Not read all the class slides and just start working on the project and get the hands on experience was far better choice then the amount of studying from reading.

#### Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

- All of it. All of it was difficult. Very limited time to learn and to build this application. Amazingly, I got it done.

#### What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?

- I would make the css styling much more visually appealing and added more weather information on to more cards on screen rather than just one card. It would be cool to fill the screen with information.
